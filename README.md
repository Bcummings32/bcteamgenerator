# bcteamgenerator

This is a node application that allows the user to input the name of an employee and their role,
which is either Manager, Engineer, or intern. The user is then prompted with questions about the employee
they are inputting. Once they have entered all the employees they want to, the app produces an updated 
page with cards with the information for each employee.
